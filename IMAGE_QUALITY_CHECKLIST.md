# Cover Art Quality Checklist

## For Each Download

- [ ] **Region**: PAL/EUR (NOT NTSC/USA)
- [ ] **Format**: PNG or JPG (will convert to WebP)
- [ ] **Resolution**: Minimum 500x500px
- [ ] **Quality**: Professional boxart, no damage or grading marks
- [ ] **Content**: Official cover art (NOT screenshot/fan art)
- [ ] **File Size**: 50KB-500KB (original, not optimized yet)

## Rejection Criteria

❌ Photo/scan with visible wear or grading marks (e.g., "Mint 9/10")
❌ NTSC/USA version (will be incompatible with European store)
❌ Screenshot from gameplay
❌ Fan-made or modified artwork
❌ Watermarks or website logos
❌ Low resolution (<400px)
❌ Heavily compressed/pixelated

## What to Look For

✅ Clean, professional Nintendo official cover art
✅ Complete game box (front cover)
✅ Clear, vibrant colors
✅ Proper aspect ratio (roughly square)
✅ European region designation (PAL, EUR, ENG)
✅ High resolution (preferably 1000x1000px or larger)

## File Naming

Save to: `.cover-art-temp/` folder with naming:
```
[SKU]-[game-slug].png
```

Examples:
- `SW-042-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild.png`
- `3DS-015-pokemon-moon.png`
- `CON-003-nintendo-switch.png`

## Troubleshooting

**No image found?**
- Try fallback sources (GameFAQs, MobyGames, IGDB)
- Search "[Game Name] box art" on Google Images
- Check archive.org for historical listings

**Image quality unclear?**
- If in doubt, skip and come back later
- No harm in trying - validation system will reject if unsuitable
- Better to have fewer perfect images than many mediocre ones

**File too large?**
- That's OK - conversion system will optimize to WebP
- Larger original = more detail = better quality
